Kiji is aimed at creating a Entrprise Service Bus for dummys. A Middleware layer for functional, data and service based integration
The main difference between Kiji and the various commercial and open source offerings is that it does offer lots of scenarios out of the box.
You can use it without the need of development or technical skills.

Normally setting up any of the existing offerings is impossible without detailed technical skills.
Even worse normally before you can get even the slightest benefit it is lots of work by highly skilled personel needs to be done.

This is not how Kiji works. It is based on a simple to understand components and comes with a set of tools to make it very easy
to get first result and benefit from the it.
This can also be done by people without deep technical skills.
Bottom line Kiji wants to be the mobile phone that everyone can use in the integration business.

I have worked in the Integration business for many many years in lots and lots of different context.
Its time to retire and make business users less dependand on people like me.
